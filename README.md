# Python Projects

## Here is a sample of what I've done with Python 

# Codecademy 'Biodiversity' Project:
(https://github.com/calebewhite/PythonProjects/blob/main/biodiversityproject.ipynb)

- Manipulated, queried and summarized national park species data with Pandas
- Performed chi-squared test on processed data to determine which types of species have more conservation status using SciPy
- Manipulated national park observation data and merged with species data using Pandas
- Visualized species per conservation status and observations of a species per park with PyPlot

# Codecademy 'Musclehub' Project:
(https://github.com/calebewhite/PythonProjects/blob/main/musclehubproject.ipynb)

- Manipulated and merged dataframes to represent entire sales funnel using Pandas
- Determined conversion rates at each step of sales funnel with Pandas
- Performed chi-squared tests to identify significant differences in conversion rates at each step of funnel between two test groups using SciPy
- Visualized differences in conversion rates between test groups for each step of funnel with PyPlot

# MISY225 GUIs:
(https://github.com/calebewhite/PythonProjects/blob/main/MISY225_GUIs.ipynb)

- Created function and GUI to calculate interest on checking/savings accounts
- Created function and GUI to create a custom pizza and return price
