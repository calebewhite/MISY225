# Python Projects

## Here is a sample of what I've done with Python 

# Codecademy Biodiversity Project:

- Manipulated, queried and summarized national park species data with Pandas
- Performed chi-squared test on processed data to determine which types of species have more conservation status using SciPy
- Manipulated national park observation data and merged with species data using Pandas
- Visualized species per conservation status and observations of a species per park with PyPlot

# MISY225 GUIs:
